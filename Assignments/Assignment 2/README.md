You may do your assignments individually or as a group of 2 or 3 members. In case you work as the same group as in the first assignment, there is no need to inform me beforehand. On the other hand, if you want to form a new group, then please infrom me via Teams no later than 18th May.
In case you prefer to submit an online version, you must submit your work as a single pdf file. Please check that your work can be viewed without any problems after uploading it.

In case you work as a group, both problems should be solved according to the student id of the same group member.
You can exchange opinions about the problems, but each student / group should do the assignment by themselves. Copied works will not be evaluated.
Please contact me via Teams in case you have any hesitations.
